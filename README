Tie/Hash/Expire version 0.02
===============================

Hashes tied to Tie::Hash::Expire behave like normal hashes in all respects except that when a key is added or the value associated with a key is changed, the current time is stored, and after 'expire_seconds' the key and value are removed from the hash.

Resolutions finer than seconds are available if the module finds access to Time::HiRes.  If Time::HiRes is available, you can expect expiration to be accurate to 0.001 seconds.  You may specify 'expire_seconds' to be decimal numbers like 5.12 .  If Time::HiRes is available, this number will be used precisely.  If you specify a decimal number and don't have access to Time::HiRes, a warning is generated and the code will function as though you specified the next higher integer.

The number of seconds specified by 'expire_seconds' is taken to mean an absolute maximum lifespan for the key, at the resolution described above.  In other words, if you set 'expire_seconds' to 1 second, and do not have Time::HiRes, keys could expire as quickly as the next machine instruction, but will not last longer than 1 second.
