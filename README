Tie/Hash/Expire version 0.01
===============================

Hashes tied to Tie::Hash::Expire behave like normal hashes in all respects except that when a key is added or the value associated with a key is changed, the current time is stored, and after 'expire_seconds' the key and value are removed from the hash.

No finer resolution is currently available than seconds.  The number of seconds specified by 'expire_seconds' is taken to mean an absolute maximum lifespan for the key.  In other words, if you set 'expire_seconds' to 1 second, keys could expire as quickly as the next machine instruction, but will not last longer than 1 second.
