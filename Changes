Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Hash::Expire.

0.01	Thu Jan 29 16:27:58 PST 2004
	- original version

0.02
	- If "expire_seconds" is set to zero all hash keys will expire
		immediately.  If "expire_seconds" is omitted or set to undef
		hash keys will not expire at all.
	- Support for Time::HiRes included.  If Time::HiRes is available, 
		expiration will occur at the highest resolution available
		through that module.  Decimal expiration times are now
		available.  If decimal expirations are specified and
		Time::HiRes is not available, a warning is generated, but the
		code will function as though the next larger integer was
		specified.

0.03
	- Bug Fix:  Fixed problem with keys expire during iteration with
		FIRSTKEY / NEXTKEY
